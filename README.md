## 🌟 About

Since Apple hasn't brought their beautiful Journal app to macOS yet, I decided to create a native macOS version that captures the same elegant simplicity and thoughtful features. This app lets you document your thoughts, track emotions, and reflect on your days - all with a clean, native macOS interface.
